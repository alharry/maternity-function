  abstract = {Abstract To effectively protect at-risk sharks, resource managers and conservation practitioners must have a good understanding of how fisheries removals contribute to changes in abundance and how regulatory restrictions may impact a population trajectory. This means they need to know the number of animals being removed from a population and whether a given number of removals will lead to population increases or declines. For white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), theoretical quantities like the intrinsic rate of population increase or rebound potential (ability to increase in size following decline) are difficult to conceptualize in terms of real-world abundance changes, which limits our ability to answer practical management questions. To address this shortfall, we designed a simulation model to evaluate how our understanding of longevity and life history variability of white shark affects our understanding of population trends in the Northwest Atlantic. Then, we quantified the magnitude of removals that could have caused historical population declines, compared these to biologically based reference points, and explored the removal scenarios which would result in population increase. Our results suggest that removals on the order of 100s of juveniles per year could have resulted in population-level declines in excess of 60\% during the 1970s and 1980s. Conservation actions implemented since the 1990s would have needed to be nearly 100\% effective at preventing fishing mortality in order for the population to double in abundance over the last 30 years. Total removals from all fleets needed to be exceptionally small to keep them below biological reference points for white shark in the Northwest Atlantic. The population's inherent vulnerability to fishing pressure reaffirms the need for restrictive national and international conservation measures, even under a situation of abundance increase.},

Length-at-maturity differed depending on the criterion adopted for defining maturity. In the case of males, length-at-maturity was smallest when condition of seminal vesicles was adopted as a maturity criterion. For females, length-at-maturity was smallest when the largest follicle diameter {$>$} 3 mm was adopted as the criterion for maturity; this was appropriate only as an indicator of the onset of maturity. Mature males are capable of mating throughout the year. Females have a continuous asynchronous reproductive cycle. The sex ratio of embryos is 1 : 1 and litter size and near-term embryo length increase with maternal length. Females have an ovarian cycle and gestation period of two years. This was reflected in the differences found between the maturity and maternity ogives. Although all females are mature at 600 mm, only 50\% of them contribute to annual recruitment each year. Hence, for chondrichthyan species with reproductive cycles of two, three or more years, if maturity ogives are used in population assessments instead of maternity ogives, the models will overestimate recruitment rates.},

In total, 2714 specimens (1616 males and 1098 females) were collected from surveys carried out using research vessels. Males ranged from 225 to 861 mm total length (LT) and females from 235 to 925 mm LT. The size at maturity of females (651 mm) was significantly greater than that of males (565 mm). The maximum proportion of mature individuals (Pmax) of the gestation ogive was \textexclamdown 1, which indicates that a proportion of mature females was not in gestation. This inactivity may be explained by the occurrence of resting periods between cycles or by the asynchrony of the reproductive cycle. The estimated Pmax for the maternity ogive suggested that about one third of mature females were in the maternity stage (i.e. with embryos \textquestiondown 156 mm). The temporal and spatial co-occurrence of non-gravid adult females at different stages of ovarian development, as well as gravid females at all embryonic development stages would indicate that the female reproductive cycle in the south-western Atlantic Ocean is asynchronous. The results indicate that S. acanthias is susceptible to fishing pressure on account of its length at maturity, extended reproductive cycles and low fecundity.},

This approach provides a useful framework for comparison with other currently used methods of assessment, especially those that rely only on \textregistered shery-dependent data, and thus can be helpful to stock assessments and to the rational exploitation and management of shark stocks. A review of demographic analyses of large coastal sharks on the east coast of the US indicates that the lemon and sandbar sharks have very low rates of population increase (r{$<$}1.2\% year\"y1) and are thus extremely vulnerable to exploitation. In contrast, one of the small coastal group species of lesser importance to the \textregistered sheries, the bonnethead shark, has some of the highest r values yet calculated for any shark. Preliminary demographic analyses using nonvalidated age estimates indicate that two other common and economically valuable large coastal species, the blacktip and dusky sharks, may also exhibit relatively slow rates of population change and be very vulnerable to overexploitation. Improved assessment of shark stocks requires increased collection of biological and \textregistered shery data, and a much better understanding of their population dynamics, especially stock{$\pm$}recruitment relationships.}

Longevity estimates based on vertebral ageing were 9 and 14 years for male and female C. sorrah and 13 and 15 years for C. tilstoni. However, an age-validation study failed to validate annual banding in larger individuals, suggesting that maximum age may be underestimated by vertebrae. C. sorrah grew to adult size relatively fast, reaching maturity at 2.3\textendash 2.4 years, whereas C. tilstoni grew slower, reaching maturity at 5.2\textendash 6.1 years. For both species, however, reproduction did not commence until approximately a year after maturity, at 3.4 years for C. sorrah and 7.2 years for C. tilstoni. The results of the present study suggest that in the GBRWHA, C. tilstoni, in particular, begins reproducing at an older age and lives longer than previously thought.}

To better define regional variability, the current study collected 1490 finetooth sharks (831 female, 659 male) from the northern Gulf of Mexico. The size-at-maturity was determined to be 995- and 961-mm fork length for females and males respectively.

Life-history theory predicts that organisms will provide an optimal level of parental investment for offspring survival balanced against the effects on their own survival and future reproductive potential. 2. Optimal resource allocation models also predict an increase in reproductive output with age as expected future reproductive effort decreases. To date, maternal investment in sharks has received limited attention. 3. We found that neonatal dusky sharks (Carcharhinus obscurus) are not independent from maternal resource allocation at the point of parturition but instead are provisioned with energy reserves in the form of an enlarged liver that constitutes approximately 20\% of total body mass. 4. Analysis of long-term archived data sets showed that a large proportion of this enlarged liver is utilized during the first weeks or months of life suggesting that the reported weight loss of newborn sharks signifies a natural orientation process and is not necessarily related to prey abundance and/or indicative of high mortality rates. 5. Interrogation of near-term pup mass in two carcharhinids, the dusky and spinner shark (Carcharhinus brevipinna), further revealed an increase in reproductive output with maternal size, with evidence for a moderate decline in the largest mothers. 6. For the dusky shark, there was a trade-off between increasing litter size and near-term pup mass in support of optimal offspring size theory. 7. For both the dusky and spinner shark, there was a linear increase in near-term pup mass with month, which may indicate variable parturition strategies and/or that carcharhinids are able to adjust the length of the gestation period. 8. The identification of optimal size-specific reproductive output has direct implications for improving the reproductive potential of exploited shark populations and for structuring future management strategies.},

Increased understanding of aggregation patterns, combined with recent advances in technology have, however, facilitated a new breadth of studies revealing fresh insights into the biology and ecology of white sharks. Although we may no longer be able to refer to the white shark as a little-known, elusive species, there remain numerous key questions that warrant investigation and research focus. Although white sharks have separate populations, they seemingly share similar biological and ecological traits across their global distribution. Yet, white shark's behavior and migratory patterns can widely differ, which makes formalizing similarities across its distribution challenging. Prioritization of research questions is important to maximize limited resources because white sharks are naturally low in abundance and play important regulatory roles in the ecosystem. Here, we consulted 43 white shark experts to identify these issues. The questions listed and developed here provide a global road map for future research on white sharks to advance progress toward key goals that are informed by the needs of the research community and resource managers.}

The length at which 50\% of the male population is mature based on clasper calcification was 803 mm, 1282 mm and 1784 mm TL for O. ornatus, O. maculatus and O. halei, respectively, and was similar to female onset of maturity based on uterus condition and to TL-at-maternity. These species of wobbegong had synchronous, triennial reproductive cycles. Follicles took 2 years to enlarge before ovulation. During the first year, follicles remained small, and then grew rapidly during the second year before ovulation during November. Gestation lasted similar to 10-11 months and parturition occurred during September -October. Mean litter sizes were nine ( s.e. 0.5) and 21 ( s.e. 1.5) for O. ornatus and O. maculatus, respectively, and increased with female total length in O. ornatus. Pregnant O. ornatus and O. maculatus were frequently caught in northern NSW and no pregnant wobbegongs, or females with large, yolky follicles were captured south of Sydney. Differences in the reproductive conditions of wobbegongs caught in northern and central NSW suggested geographically dependent reproductive behaviour. Knowledge of the reproductive parameters provided in this paper is necessary for adequate fisheries management and species conservation assessments.}

  abstract = {Even though Bayesian methods can provide statistically rigorous assessments of the biological status of fisheries resources, uninformative data (e.g., declining catch rate series with little variation in fishing effort) can produce highly imprecise parameter estimates. This can be counteracted with the use of informative Bayesian prior distributions (priors) for model parameters. We develop priors for the intrinsic rate of increase (r) in the Schaefer surplus production model using demographic methods and illustrate the utility of this with an application to large coastal sharks in the Atlantic. In 1996, a U.S. stock assessment obtained a point estimate for r of 0.26. For such long-lived and low-fecund organisms, this could potentially be too high. Yet it was used to predict that within about 10 years, a 50\% reduction in the 1995 catch level should result in {$>$} 50\% chance of increasing the population to the abundance required to produce maximum sustainable yield. In contrast, a Bayesian assessment that used demographic analysis to construct a prior for r with a median of 0.07 and coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.7 indicated that within 30 years, this policy would have only a very small chance of increasing the population to maximum sustainable yield.}

The smallest mature male measured 10\^A{$\cdot$}5 cm WD and the largest immature individual 13\^A{$\cdot$}7 cm WD.

The smallest mature female measured 10\^A{$\cdot$}5 cm WD; the size at first maturity was 52\^A{$\cdot$}8\% of maximum WD, and estimated WD50 was between 11\^A{$\cdot$}8 and 12\^A{$\cdot$}3 cm. Embryos were found in females \^a\textyen 10\^A{$\cdot$}5 cm WD and maximum fecundity was three embryos per female (mode = 1) and varied with maternal size. Embryos were found in all months, but three birthing peaks per year were identified and a gestation period of 4\^a5 months estimated. Based on ovulation time, embryonic growth and parturition dates, a triannual reproductive cycle was inferred for this species, with overlapping ovarian and uterine cycles. These results suggest that U. rogersi has a reproductive strategy based on low fecundity, a rapid reproductive cycle (short ovulation and gestation time), three birth peaks per year and large embryos. This strategy probably allows U. rogersi to withstand the fishing pressure they are subject to on the Colombian Pacific coast. The results also suggest that the study area is an important nursery and reproductive area for this species.},

Dasyatis violacea, with few age classes, was used to demonstrate the basics of Leslie-matrix and stage-based matrix model calculations. The demography for Carcharias taurus, with a 2-year reproductive cycle, produced higher potential population growth using actual fertility rather than effective annual fertility. The demography for Alopias pelagicus, with continuous reproduction, produced higher potential population growth for a birth-flow than a birth-pulse population. The Carcharodon carcharias example demonstrated only a small difference in potential population growth between step-like and logistic fertility functions. Stage-based models with fixed stage duration produced potential population growths identical to those obtained from a life-history table or Leslie matrix, but the net reproductive rates and generation times differed. Stage-based models with few stages had different dynamics with shorter recovery to the stable age distribution; they underestimated the elasticity of juvenile survival and overestimated the elasticity of adult survival, suggesting that interpretation should be cautious. Elasticity analyses were used to estimate the number of juvenile age classes that could be fished and have the same effect on potential population growth as fishing all the adult age classes.}

The sharp increase of the amplitude of the values of reproductive variables at a given fork length (FL) was evidence that from that FL reproduction occurred. Thus, we calculated the proportion of mature sharks in FL classes to estimate the median size at maturity. The accelerated growth of the claspers started before the beginning of the testis maturation and semen production, whereas the accelerated development of the ovary and the oviducal glands started simultaneously. Although most females with mating marks were mature, few had sperm stored in the oviducal glands. The population parameter of size at 50\% of maturity was estimated at 171.2cm FL for females and 180.2cm FL for males. The median size at maternity was estimated in 193.9cm FL and half of the females with five to six years old were recruited for reproductive phase of life. As most shark species, P. glauca in the Southwest Atlantic reach maturity at about three-fourths of its maximum size and half of its maximum age. Median litter size was 33 embryos. A positive not significant linear relationship between the uterine fecundity and the size of the pregnant female was observed.},

The data were fitted to the von Bertalanffy growth equation after adopting the Francis reparametrization and correcting for sampling bias caused by the selectivity effects of the gill-nets of various mesh sizes used to capture the sharks. The von Bertalanffy growth curves of male and female gummy shark were significantly different, but the growth curves of male and female school shark were not. The growth curves suggest that growth rates of male and female gummy shark in Bass Strait were lower during 1986-87 than during 1973-76 and that the growth rates of male and female gummy shark and school shark in Bass Strait during 1986-87 were lower than those in South Australia at the same time. These apparent temporal and spatial differences in growth patterns of gummy shark are explained by the 'Phenomenon of Apparent Change in Growth Rate'. It is concluded that the growth curves determined for 1986-87 are distorted by the effects of a long history of high and length-selective fishing mortality and that actual growth patterns of gummy shark are better represented by the von Bertalanffy growth equation determined for shark caught in Bass Strait during 1973-76, when fishing mortality was much lower. Verification of age estimates was attempted by comparing von Bertalanffy growth curves derived from age-length data with those derived from tag release-recapture length-increment data, but these comparisons highlight the limitations of using tag data for this purpose. Although reasonable agreement was found between such growth curves for gummy shark, it appears that school shark older than 11 years cannot be aged accurately from stained whole or sectioned vertebrae. Sectioned vertebrae from a school shark recaptured 35.7 years after being tagged and released and calculated as having an age exceeding 45 years gave estimates of only 18-20 years of age.}

Based on the analysis of two fishery-dependent sampling periods (1993\textendash 1994 and 2007\textendash 2014), this study aimed to determine reproductive parameters and identify temporal differences between the two time periods. In the first sampling period, 776 males and 352 females with a size range of 28.0\textendash 120.0 cm total stretched length (LT) were analysed, and in the second sampling period, 387 males and 432 females with a size range of 28.0\textendash 122.0 cm LT were analysed. The size at 50\% maturity in the second sampling period was significantly different between sexes, 82.6 cm LT for females and 73.8 cm LT for males (no estimation was possible for the first sampling period). The size at 50\% maternity was not different between sampling periods, 97.3 cm LT for the first sampling period and 99.0 cm LT for the second sampling period. Litter size varied from 3 to 19 embryos and the average was not statistically different in both periods, 10.1 (S.D. = 3.8) for the first sampling period and 11.3 (S.D. = 3.5) for the second sampling period. The female reproductive cycle is asynchronous, and it seems to be annual, with a gestation period of 5\textendash 6 months, and a consecutive ovarian cycle and gestation period. Temporal (between sampling periods) and latitudinal (southern Gulf versus northern regions) variations occur in the synchronicity of the reproductive cycle, temporal variation in the relationship between maternal length and litter size, and latitudinal variation in average size of mature sharks.},

Indices of maturity were constructed using measurements of gonads, reproductive tracts and claspers, and sandbar sharks exhibited 50\% maturity sizes of 140 and 148 cm fork length for males and females respectively. Gonado-somatic indices and variation in reproductive tract condition were used to determine seasonal trends in reproduction of mature C. plumbeus. Sandbar sharks have discrete seasonal reproductive cycles in which males produce sperm from January to May with a peak in May and females develop eggs from January to May with ovulation occurring in June. Females were shown to exhibit a \textquestiondown 2 year reproductive cycle. Embryonic development was assessed through measurements of masses and lengths of uterine contents. Gestation was 12 months, from July to the following June, with parturition in late June.

The model incorporates the peculiarities of shark populations and fisheries, including the pupping process and the selectivity characteristics of gill-nets. Estimates are determined by a Bayesian approach that incorporates prior distributions for virgin biomass, the parameter that determines productivity, and the variation in pup survival. Tests of sensitivity include changing the data series used, varying the value of adult natural mortality, and changing the prior distribution for the productivity parameter. The point estimates of the mature biomass at the start of 1995 range from 13\% to 45\% of the pre-exploitation equilibrium size, depending on the specifications of the assessment. The results are notably sensitive to the selection of a catch-rate series. Results suggest that the current fishing intensity will lead to further declines in abundance, that a reduction of similar to 20\% in fishing mortality would achieve a 0.5 probability of not declining further, and that a reduction of 42\% would achieve with a probability of 0.8 the management goal of not being below the 1996 mature biomass at the start of 2011.}

This study focused on life-history parameters and reproductive cycles of four mobulid rays (Mobula thurstoni, Mobula japanica, Mobula tarapacana, and Manta birostris), and re-estimated their intrinsic population growth rates. Size and reproductive data were collected from 1,509 specimens (30\% of catch) landed in two fishing seasons in 2015 and 2016. Size-at-birth was reviewed, and analysis of the embryos and follicles did not show any clear seasonality in the reproductive cycle, but supported an interbreeding interval. Females of all species matured at a larger size than males, and exhibited a larger size-at-pregnancy than -at-maturity. This delay in reproduction resulted in population growth rates lower than the actual r\textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown max\textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown{} when based on size-at-pregnancy (r\textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown mat\textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown{} = r\textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown max\textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown{} = 0.016\textendash 0.055 year\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown -1\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} and r\textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown preg\textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown{} = 0.008\textendash 0.044 year\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown -1\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown ), and a population doubling time of 15.8\textendash 86.6 years. This study suggests that population growth rates previously reported were overestimated. In light of the Convention on International Trades of Endangered Species (CITES) and Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) assessments, while fisheries management should reflect the delayed maturation of these species and the slower population growth potential, at the current status of these population, the sustainability of any exploitation level seems unrealistic and strongly discouraged.}

Using a variety of life history traits (maximum size, size and age at maturity, longevity, growth rate, litter and birth size) we demonstrated differences in chondrichthyan life histories between shelf, pelagic and deep-water habitats and within the deep habitat down the continental slope and across geographic regions. Deep-water species had lower growth rates, later age at maturity, and higher longevity than both shelf and pelagic species. In the deep habitat, with increasing depth, species matured later, lived longer, had smaller litters and bred less frequently; regional differences in traits were also apparent. Deep-water species also had a smaller body size and the invariants of relative size and age at maturity were higher in deep water. The visual interaction hypothesis offers a potential explanation for these findings and it is apparent habitat influences the trade-offs in allocation of energy for survival and reproduction. Body size is not appropriate as a predictor of vulnerability in deep-water chondrichthyans and regional trait differences are possibly due to a fishing pressure response. Deep-water chondrichthyans are more vulnerable to exploitation than shelf and pelagic species and this vulnerability markedly increases with increasing depth. The life history traits of deep-water chondrichthyans are unique and reflect adaptations driven by both mortality and resource limitations of their habitat.},

The estimated LT at which 50\% of females are mature is 799 mm (95\% c.i.: 794, 804), whereas the LT at which 50\% are maternal is 825 mm (95\% c.i.: 817\textendash 833), but these estimates are probably biased by the phenomenon of apparent change of LT at maternity and LT at maturity following severe length-selective fishing mortality. Litters ranged from four to 15 embryos with a 1:1 sex ratio, and litter size increased with maternal length. The breeding cycle of males is neither seasonal nor synchronous with the female cycle. The estimated LT of males where 50\% are mature was 629 mm (95\% c.i.: 603, 645).},

A 4950 mm total length (TL) gravid female accidentally caught by fishermen in the Okinawa Prefecture, Southern Japan carried six embryos (543-624 mm TL, three in each uterus). Both uteri contained copious amounts of yellowish viscous uterine fluid (over 79.2 litres in the left uterus), nutrient eggs and broken egg cases. The embryos had yolk stomachs that had ruptured, the mean volume of which was approximately 197.9 ml. Embryos had about 20 rows of potentially functional teeth in the upper and lower jaws. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive substances were observed on the surface and in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells, and large, secretory, OsO4-oxidized lipid droplets of various sizes were distributed on the surface of the villous string epithelium on the uterine wall. Histological examination of the uterine wall showed it to consist of villi, similar to the trophonemata of Dasyatidae rays, suggesting that the large amount of fluid found in the uterus of the white shark was likely required for embryo nutrition. We conclude that: (1) the lipid-rich fluid is secreted from the uterine epithelium only in early gestation before the onset of oophagy, (2) the embryos probably use the abundant uterine fluid and encased nutrient eggs for nutrition at this stage of their development, and (3) the uterine fluid is the major source of embryonic nutrition before oophagy onset. This is the first record of the lipid histotrophy of reproduction among all shark species.}

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that by 1991 the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) population along the Atlantic coast of the United States had declined in abundance to approximately 20\% of its level in the late 1970s. This phenomenon allowed us to test the hypothesis that compensatory (density dependent) growth occurred after severe population reduction. Age and growth of sandbar sharks were investigated by counting rings and back-calculating lengths at previous ages from vertebral samples collected in 1980-1981 and 1991-1992. The collections included 188 sharks from 1980-1981 and 412 sharks from 1990-1991 ranging in length from 51-172 cm precaudal length (PCL). All sharks were mature at lengths {$>$} 136 cm PCL. Minimum and maximum ring counts, which included a birth mark, were 1 and 25. Age at maturity was 15-16 years for both sample periods and both sexes. For sexes combined, the von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L(infinity) = 199 cm PCL, K = 0.057, t(0) = -4.9 years for the 1980-1981 sample and L(infinity) = 164 cm PCL, K = 0.089, t(0) = -3.8 years for the 1991-1992 sample. Statistical tests found significant differences between the two growth models. Significant differences in size at age and annual incremental growth of juveniles suggest a small increase in juvenile sandbar shark growth rate between the two sampling periods. However, age at maturity was unchanged between samples suggesting that any biological significance of a growth rate increase has not been realized.}

  abstract = {Understanding the relationship between abundance of spawners and subsequent recruitment is one of the central issues in fisheries stock assessment. We developed a new, pre-recruit survival based stock\textendash recruitment model that enables explicit modeling of survival between embryos and age 0 recruits, and allows the description of a wide range of pre-recruit survival curves. The model is especially useful for low fecundity species that produce relatively few offspring per litter and exhibit a more direct connection between spawning output and recruitment than species generating millions of eggs. The proposed model provides additional flexibility in the stock\textendash recruitment options that may be explored in any fishery stock assessment, and it is now available within the Stock Synthesis assessment platform. In this paper, we describe the mathematical formulation of the new stock\textendash recruitment model, explain how this model can be specified within Stock Synthesis, and use it to model the stock\textendash recruitment relationship of the spiny dogfish shark in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. We compare the results of the application of our new stock\textendash recruitment model, with those from traditional Beverton\textendash Holt relationship, and illustrate why the new approach is more appropriate for this species.},

This localised species is taken as bycatch in several inshore fisheries and potentially impacted by a range of other anthropogenic pressures, including introduced species, particularly in shallow-water pupping areas. T. imitata can be characterised as a species of comparatively low matrotrophic histotrophy with an extended period of relatively large eggs in utero (5-8 months) followed by rapid growth of the embryos (4-6 months). The reproductive cycle is annual with parturition occurring during late-February-April, followed immediately by ovulation. Mean size-at-birth is similar to 225 mm total length and there is a similar to 1000\% gain in mean wet mass from egg (15 g) to full-term embryo in utero (150 g), the lowest reported for any viviparous batoid. Litter size increases with maternal length, reaching a maximum of seven, and sex ratio of embryos is 1 : 1. Maximum length and estimates of the maturity-ogive parameters l(50) and l(95) are similar for females and males.}

  abstract = {Observations of synchronous rapid growth of embryos and ovarian follicles in pregnant females during the half-year December\textendash May leading to parturition, ovulation, mating, and fertilization suggest Urolophus cruciatus has the capacity for an annual reproductive cycle. Conversely, the higher proportion of the pregnant females in the population carrying eggs than carrying embryos in utero during December\textendash May and all pregnant females in the population only carrying eggs in utero during June\textendash November indicate a longer reproductive cycle. Analysis based on the usual assumptions implies that the species most likely exhibits a biennial cycle with \textbackslash textasciitilde18-month period of diapause following ovulation prior to \textbackslash textasciitilde6-month period of rapid embryogenesis. However, it is feasible that the period of the cycle is triennial with \textbackslash textasciitilde30-month period of diapause or alternatively diapause varies among individuals and varies from year to year. Rather than exhibiting a fixed-term reproductive cycle where obligatory diapause leads to parturition timed every year to provide favourable conditions for neonates, as suggested for several other chondrichthyan species, U. cruciatus may exhibit facultative diapause where the period of diapause and hence the reproductive cycle varies depending on the prevailing environmental conditions or density-dependent factors as described for many terrestrial species. U. cruciatus is highly matrotrophic ({$>$}4000 \% wet mass gain from ovum to full-term embryo), litter size (1\textendash 4) increases with maternal length, sex ratio among embryos is 1:1, and male breeding condition varies seasonally with peak sperm production coinciding with female ovulation.}

  abstract = {A dynamic pool simulation model is derived and applied to the gummy shark stock of the  southern shark fishery. Inputs to the model are fishing effort reported by fishers for hooks  and for gill-nets with mesh sizes of 6 inches (152 mm), 7 inches (178 mm) and 8 inches  (203 mm) along with estimates for growth, natural mortality, catchability, hook and gill-net  mesh selectivity, size at maturity and fecundity of females, sex ratio at birth, and length-weight  relationships. Growth is described by the von Bertalanffy equation; hook selectivity is constant  with length for sharks recruited to the fishery; gill-net selectivity is based on the probability  density distribution of the gamma function where selectivity varies with the mesh size of the  gill-nets and the length of the sharks; number of births is related to the proportion of females  mature at each length, and the relationship between number of births and maternal weight is  linear; parturition is annual and time is standardized so that parturition occurs at the beginning  of each year; sex ratio at birth is based on observations of a 1: 1 sex ratio of embryos; and  allometric weight-length is based on the power curve. Natural mortality of recruits, catchability,  reproduction and growth parameters are held constant, but density-dependent natural mortality  of prerecruits is varied in proportion to stock abundance. The model is used to simulate effects  of historical longline fishing effort and gill-net fishing effort for each mesh size on stock biomass,  numbers of sharks in the stock, and numbers of births. The performance of the model is  evaluated by comparing simulated annual catches and the simulated mean weight of sharks  captured with annual catches reported by the fishers and the mean weight of sharks sampled in  commercial landings. Uncertainties surrounding estimates of some of the parameters are discussed.  Notwithstanding its shortcomings, the model indicates that the stock of gummy shark has been  severely reduced and is in danger of further depletion unless immediate action is taken to reduce  the commercial catch.}

Differences in synchronous ovarian and parturition cycles, mostly annual west and biennial east of longitude 138 degrees E, are explained by environmental differences. Ovulation and parturition peak during November-December and the gestation period is similar to 12 months. Largest ovarian follicle diameter ranges from 15 to 28 mm at ovulation, and mean wet mass gain is 10-fold from in utero egg (similar to 10 g) to full-term embryo (similar to 100 g) at similar to 330mm total length. The sex ratio of embryos in utero is 1:1, and litter size (1 to 57 embryos) rises curvilinearly with maternal length. Length-at-maternity and length-at-maturity increased with rising fishing mortality and subsequently decreased with falling fishing mortality. These patterns are explained by the hypothesis on the 'phenomenon of apparent change of size-at-maternity' (and size-at-maturity) caused by gill-net length-selective fishing mortality, which masks any potential density-dependent responses. Male length-at-maturity estimates from seminal vesicle condition, testis development and spermatogenesis stages are similar, but are less than estimates from clasper calcification. Maximum body mass of females is double that of males and, at any length {$>$} 700 mm, mean body mass of females exceeds that of males.}
